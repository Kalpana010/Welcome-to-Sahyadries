                            Raigad, situated in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India, is a formidable hill fort located in the town of Mahad. It holds a prominent position as one of the strongest fortresses on the Deccan Plateau and was historically referred to as Rairee or Rairy fort.
                            Chhatrapati Shivaji, the renowned Maratha ruler, along with the Chief Engineer Hiroji Indulkar, oversaw the construction and development of various buildings and structures within Raigad. In 1674, after being crowned the king of the Maratha kingdom, Shivaji chose Raigad as his capital. Under his reign, the Maratha Empire flourished and expanded to encompass a significant portion of western and central India.
                            Perched at an elevation of 820 metres (2,700 ft) (2,700 ft) above its base and 1,356 m (4,449 ft) (4,449 ft) above sea level within the Sahyadri mountain range, the fort offers breathtaking views. Accessing the fort requires ascending approximately 1,737 steps. Alternatively, visitors can opt for the Raigad Ropeway, an aerial tramway spanning 750 m (2,460 ft) (2,460 ft) in length and reaching a height of 400 m (1,300 ft) (1,300 ft), which conveniently transports them from the ground to the fort in just four minutes.
